# Daily Brew Coffee Sales Analytics Dashboard (Case Study)

# Overview
This project is a case study simulation for Daily Brew Coffee Ltd., a fast-growing NYC coffee chain operating 15+ outlets. As described in the assignment, the company collects massive transaction data but struggles with "data chaos"—making decisions based on feelings rather than facts. In this case study, I step in as Junior BI Analyst to build an interactive 5-page Power BI dashboard that delivers clarity: answering Rachel's key questions like monthly performance, top stores/products, promo impact, loyal customers, peak times, staff performance, and basket size.
The dashboard reveals $4.25M revenue, 99.51% loyalty, and opportunities like 15% uplift from morning staffing. It transforms raw data into meaning, aligning with the case's mission: "Stop guessing, start knowing."

Case Study Context

Business Challenge: Growing sales but no insights—unknown underperforming stores, promo effectiveness, customer retention, or new product performance.
Mission: Build a 3-5 page dashboard using 7 datasets (sales, stores, products, customers, employees, calendar, inventory).
Key Questions Addressed:

📈 Monthly performance (e.g., April peaks at $501K).
🏪 Top stores (e.g., 100 Church St: $1.42M).
☕ Top products (e.g., Sustainably Grown Organic: $1.07M).
🎯 Promo boost (0.69% impact—needs targeting).
👥 Loyal customers (99.51% repeat, 7-year tenure).
🕐 Peak times (mornings: $2.355K).
👨‍🍳 Staff performance (top: Britanni Jorden $0.5M).
🛒 Basket size ($1.01K avg).


Final Insights Page: Descriptive analysis with trends, anomalies, and recommendations (e.g., "Adjust morning shifts for 15% revenue gain").

# Features

    5 Interactive Pages:

Sales Analysis: Monthly trends, time-of-day revenue ($2.355K morning peak), YoY growth (90.14%).
Promo, Store & Product Analysis: Promo impact (0.69%), store maps, top products (Sustainably Grown Organic: $1.07M).
Customer Insight: Repeat customers (99.51%), age group profit (35-44: 62%), gender distribution.

Key DAX Measures: Total Sales, YoY Growth %, Promo Sales %, Repeat Customers %, Avg Sales per Employee.
Visuals: Maps, line/bar charts, gauges, scatter plots, slicers for year/store filtering.
Insights-Driven: Recommendations based on data, e.g., "Target 35-44 age group for 20% retention boost."

# Tech Stack

Power BI Desktop: Core tool for modeling and visualization.
DAX: Custom measures (e.g., time intelligence, customer metrics).
Power Query: Data cleaning and transformation.
Data Sources: 7 CSV files (sales, products, customers, stores, employees, calendar, inventory).

# Key Insights & Recommendations

Insights: Revenue peaks in April ($501K); mornings drive 55% of daily sales; loyal customers (99.51% repeat) contribute 62% profit from 35-44 age group.
Trends/Anomalies: Promo sales inconsistent (peak July, dip after); high waste in slow products (e.g., Almond Croissant: 10+ days to sell).

# Recommendations:

Adjust morning shifts for 15% revenue uplift.

Target promos to loyal customers via bundles (coffee + bakery).

Replicate top store (100 Church St) model for expansion.
